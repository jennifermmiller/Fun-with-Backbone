Fun-with-Backbone
=================

This repo was originally created for the sole purpose of getting myself better accquainted with Backbone. It's one in a long long line of, (you mmight have guessed it!) todo apps.

To help shore up all of the aspects of Backbone, I headed back to familiar ground to work on refactoring. I also wanted more experience with parse.
